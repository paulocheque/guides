# Prerequisites

- node.js: Currently, Ember CLI works fine with Node (0.12) and npm (2.x) so if you already have any of this move to the next step otherwise install the latest 5.9.0.

To check for the versions run 
`node --version`
`npm --version`

To install use the following guide
  [The best way to install Node.js on Mac, Linux and on Windows](http://yoember.com/nodejs/the-best-way-to-install-node-js/)

- Ember Inspector Extension

   - Chrome extension: [Ember Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi?hl=en)

   - Firefox lovers: [firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ember-inspector/)

- (Optional) Watchman from Facebook: On Mac and Linux, you can improve file watching performance by installing [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)


# Lesson 1

This tutorial uses Ember CLI tool (v2.4.2).

## Install Ember CLI 

The following `npm` command installs Ember CLI latest stable version in the global namespace. The latest Ember CLI version 2.4.2 is released on 1 of March 2016, it generates app with Ember.js v2.4 and Ember Data v2.4. (If you have an earlier version of Ember CLI, the following command automatically updates it to the latest.)

    $ npm install -g ember-cli
    
or if you would like to install with fixed version

    $ npm install -g ember-cli@2.4.2

You have now a new `ember` command in your console. Check with

    $ ember -v
    
You should see something similar:

```
version: 2.4.2 
node: 5.9.0 
os: linux x64 
```

(Node version, npm version and OS version may be different in your configuration.)

Please read more about Ember CLI here: [www.ember-cli.com](http://www.ember-cli.com)

## Create the app

In your terminal, navigate in the folder where you usually create your web applications.
For example, if you have a `projects` folder use 

```
$ cd ~/projects
```

Inside this folder run the following command.

    $ ember new library-app

This command will create the new app for you.

Please change to your new app directory with: 

```
$ cd library-app
```

Open this folder in your favourite code editor and look around. You will see a few files and folders. Ember CLI is scaffolded for you everything what need to run and create an amazing web application. 

## Launch the app

Your skeleton app is ready and you can run it with the following command. Type in your terminal:

    $ ember server

Open your new empty app in your browser: <a href="http://localhost:4200" target="_blank">http://localhost:4200</a>

You should see a "Welcome to Ember" message on your website. Well Done! You have your first Ember.js application. :)

You can open Ember Inspector in your Browser. Hope you've already installed it. Ember Inspector exists in Chrome and in Firefox as an extension. After installation you should have a new tab in your developer console in your browser. Check it out, look around. [More details about Ember Inspector here](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.4.0/ember-inspector/installation/). 

## Add Bootstrap

Let's add some basic style to our application. We use Bootstrap with Sass. Ember CLI can install for us add-ons and useful packages. These add-ons simplify our development process, because we don't have to reinvent the wheel, we get more out of the box. You can find various packages, add-ons on these websites: http://www.emberaddons.com or http://www.emberobserver.com ( I recommend you bookmark this and check them out later on - preferably after finishing this guide)

We install an add-on for Sass and another for Bootstrap.

Exit your `ember server` with `Ctrl+C` in your terminal.

Run the following two commands:

```
$ ember install ember-cli-sass
$ ember install ember-cli-bootstrap-sassy
```

This adds some code to your `package.json` and `bower.json` files.

I love using sass because of the flexibility it gives. Lets use it in our app. We start by renaming our `app.css` to `app.scss` with the following terminal command or you can use your editor to rename the `./app/styles/app.css` file:

```
$ mv app/styles/app.css app/styles/app.scss
```

Open `./app/styles/app.scss` file in your editor and add the following line:

```
@import "bootstrap";
```

If your server is still runnig adding bootstrap will not take effect immediately until you relaunch your app by hitting `ctrl-c` then `ember server` launch. You should see in the browser, that 'Welcome to Ember' uses Bootstrap default font.

## Create a navigation partial

A partial is a html snippet that is placed as a part of a larger container. In this case a navigation and the footer would be nice to be created a partial as they are independent portions of the larger page.
Can you locate where the words 'Welcome to ember' are coming from? If you can't worry less I will show you. Head to `./app/templates/application.hbs`. This is know as the main template file

Now update your main template file. Delete the example content and add the following code to your .

``` 
<div class="container">
  {{partial 'navbar'}}
  {{outlet}}
</div>
``` 

Ember uses handlebar syntax in templates. It is almost the same as plain html, but you could have dynamic elements with `{{ }}`.

The `partial` helper helps us insert snippets from other templates e.g the partial we are about to create known as `navbar`.

The `outlet` helper is a general helper, a placeholder, where deeper level content will be inserted. The `outlet` in `application.hbs` means that almost all content from other pages will appear inside this section. For this reason, `application.hbs` is a good place to determine the main structure of our website. In our case we have a `container` div, a navigation bar, and the real content.

Ember-cli uses generators which create new files and prefills with some boilerplate code. The generator takes the following shape `$ ember generate <generator-name> <options>`

So we can generate a `navbar.hbs` template file with the following command in you terminal.

    $ ember generate template navbar

You can always undo your generation by using `$ ember destroy <generator-name> <options>`

You can open `./app/templates/navbar.hbs` in your editor and add the following lines:

```
<nav class="navbar navbar-inverse">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#main-navbar">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      {{#link-to 'index' class="navbar-brand"}}Library App{{/link-to}}
    </div>

    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="main-navbar">
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
            {{#link-to 'index' tagName="li"}}<a href="">Home</a>{{/link-to}}
      </ul>
    </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse -->
  </div><!-- /.container-fluid -->
</nav>
```
